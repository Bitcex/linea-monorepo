// The package symbolic provides a tool to generate and manipulate symbolic
// expressions. A symbolic expression is a directed-acyclic-graph (DAG)
// representating a succession of arithmetic operations (addition,
// multiplication, squaring, negation, subtraction etc...) over symbolic
// variables or constants. These expressions can in turn be optimized and
// evaluated vector-wise by providing an assignment.
